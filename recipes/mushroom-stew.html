      <li>1 large leek, white and light green parts only, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups dry red wine</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tamari, or to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine mushrooms and onions in a large bowl; toss gently to mix.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Add
        mushroom-onion mixture, in batches, to cover bottom of pot in a single
        layer; cook, without stirring too much, until begins to brown and
        caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and cook until other side
        is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl using a slotted
        spoon. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pot; repeat with another batch
        mushroom-onion mixture. Repeat until all mushroom-onion mixture is
        cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season mushroom-onion mixture with salt and black pepper; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low; add 1 tablespoon oil to the same pot. Add
        carrots and leek; cook until leek turns light golden and starts to
        soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1
        minute. Stir in tomato paste; cook 1 minute. Add flour; cook and stir 1
        minute more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in wine, vegetable broth, tamari, thyme, bay leaves, and cayenne
        pepper while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pot
        with a wooden spoon. Carefully add mushroom-onion mixture; bring to a
        simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low; simmer, partly covered, until carrots and onions are
        tender and sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
